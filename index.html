        <p> Hi Everyone! My name is Emma and I am from Austin, TX. I live in North Austin width
            my husband Mike, daughter Layla, and son Jude.  We also have a gaggle of pets including
            a bearded dragon named Chili.  I currently work as a Project Manager for a restaurant 
            equipment dealer and do kitchen installs all over the country.

            I love to travel, cook, entertain, and be outside doing anything! We frequently go Colorado, New Mexico, and down 
            to South Padre Island.  We also try to go somewhere new once a year.  In the coming years, 
            I hope to travel more out side of the U.S.
        </p>
